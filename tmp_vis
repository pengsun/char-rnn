Cao Cao said, \"I am doomed, good brother. Go and save yourself.\" 
\"My lord, mount my horse quickly. I will go afoot,\" said Cao Hong. 
\"If those wretches come up, what then?\" said Cao Cao. 
\"The world can do without Cao Hong, but not without you, my lord.\" 
\"If I live, I shall owe you my life,\" said Cao Cao. 
So he mounted. Cao Hong tore off his own breastplate, gripped his sword, and went on foot after the horse. Thus they proceeded till the fourth watch when they saw before them a broad stream, and behind they still heard the shouts of pursuers drawing nearer and nearer. 
\"This is my fate,\" said Cao Cao. \"I am really doomed.\" 
Cao Hong helped Cao Cao down from his horse. Then taking off his fighting robe and helmet, Cao Hong took the wounded man on his back and waded into the stream. When they reached the further side, the pursuers had already gained the bank whence they shot arrows."

Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:

Do you love rats?

No, I hate them.

Well, I do, too-live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head with a string.

No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.

Oh, I should say so. I wish I had some now.

Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it back to me.

That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment."
