Cao Cao said, \"I am doomed, good brother. Go and save yourself.\" 
\"My lord, mount my horse quickly. I will go afoot,\" said Cao Hong. 
\"If those wretches come up, what then?\" said Cao Cao. 
\"The world can do without Cao Hong, but not without you, my lord.\" 
\"If I live, I shall owe you my life,\" said Cao Cao. 
So he mounted. Cao Hong tore off his own breastplate, gripped his sword, and went on foot after the horse. Thus they proceeded till the fourth watch when they saw before them a broad stream, and behind they still heard the shouts of pursuers drawing nearer and nearer. 
\"This is my fate,\" said Cao Cao. \"I am really doomed.\" 
Cao Hong helped Cao Cao down from his horse. Then taking off his fighting robe and helmet, Cao Hong took the wounded man on his back and waded into the stream. When they reached the further side, the pursuers had already gained the bank whence they shot arrows."

In Wu, Sun Xi, General of the Flying Cavalry, went away from the court and wailed, facing the south. 
\"Alas, ye blue heavens. What manner of man is this Sun Hao to yield thus the heritage of his family, won by the sword of General Sun Jian the Martially Glorious in the brave days that are past?\" 
Meantime the victors marched homeward, and Sun Hao went to Luoyang to present himself at court. In his capacity of minister, he prostrated himself at the feet of the Emperor of the Jin Dynasty in the Hall of Audience. He was allowed a seat."

cidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed 
with china that had been captured from him 
at Borfsov had been recovered and would be 
restored to him. 

\"You mean to imply that I have nothing to 
eat out of. ... On the contrary, I can supply 
you with everything even if you want to give 
dinner parties,\" warmly replied Chichagov, 
who tried by every word he spoke to prove 
his own rectitude and therefore imagined 
Kutuzov to be animated by the same de- 
sire. 

Kutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied 
with his subtle penetrating smile: \"I meant 
merely to say what I said.\" 

Contrary to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov 
detained the greater part of the army at Vilna. 
Those about him said that he became extra- 
ordinarily slack and physically feeble during 
his stay in that town."

had on a kind of necklace above which rose a 
high white ruffle, outlining his rather long 
face which was lit up from below. 

\"For what have you come hither?\" asked the 
newcomer, turning in Pierre's direction at a 
slight rustle made by the latter. \"Why have you, 
who do not believe in the truth of the light 
and who have not seen the light, come here? 
What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, en- 
lightenment?\" 

At the moment the door opened and the 
stranger came in, Pierre felt a sense of awe and 
veneration such as he had experienced in his 
boyhood at confession"
